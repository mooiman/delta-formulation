  abstract = {We present the first step in the development of a moving adaptive grid technique for flow and transport problems that is based on the approximate minimization in the L1 norm of the modeling error due to discretization. The technique consists of a second-order accurate discretization scheme designed for error analysis, a filter technique to ensure sufficiently smooth solutions, and an iterative solver for the nonlinear adaptive grid equations. We describe how these elements have been used for the numerical approximation of a given one-dimensional function. This application has been chosen to test and optimize the error-minimizing adaptive grid method. Results are presented for a function having a smooth part, a discontinuity and a uniform part. In comparison with a uniform grid, a gain in accuracy of a factor 10 to almost 1000 was obtained using 40 to 200 grid points.}

  abstract  = {The established method for determining dike heights and dimensioning river training structures is to assess the resulting backwater by numerical modelling. The common consensus is that bottom friction determines the backwater and that momentum advection only has a local effect. We demonstrate that the numerical/artificial backwater contribution from the momentum advection approximation can be of the same order of magnitude as the bottom friction contribution, depending on the advection scheme. This is realized using a one-dimensional analysis and verified using a set of one- and two-dimensional test problems including a wavy bed case, flow over emerged and submerged groynes and finally an actual river. We compare first- and second-order accurate advection schemes and compute their artificial contribution to the backwater, for a range of practically-feasible grid resolutions. The tests demonstrate that the conservation/constancy properties of the scheme determine the size of this contribution, rather than the order of the scheme.},
